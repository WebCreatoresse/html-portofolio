<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m a 36-year-old woman balancing a corporate job by day and a lifelong passion for fashion by… also day (and night, if there’s a good outfit involved). Single, independent, and proudly owned by a cat who runs the household with zero regard for my meeting schedule.</p>

<p>I believe great style is a form of self-expression, that coffee counts as a personality trait, and that “business casual” is open to interpretation. When I’m not navigating spreadsheets or wardrobe decisions, I’m probably curating outfits, overthinking color combinations, or pretending my cat understands my career stress.</p>

<p>This site is a little glimpse into my world—where fashion meets real life, ambition meets humor, and lint rollers are a non-negotiable accessory.</p>
